 # Me
 ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wynne
 ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building the "next-generation" technology for the world...!
 
 # Experience
 ğŸš€ I am a junior Blockchain developer with experience that includes application development, customization and up-gradation support. 
 
 ğŸš€ Experience in developing Blockchain applications that add smart contracts, improve cryptographic efficiency with aggregable signatures under the BLS        signature scheme. 
 
 ğŸš€ Identifying a roadmap to a Quantum Resistant aggregable signatures, and mathematically proving the safety and liveness properties of the extended          system using TLA+ proofs. 
 
 ğŸš€ This improves the platform's throughput and finalization speed, allows sophisticated transactions, and ensures the finished product is mathematically      sound.
